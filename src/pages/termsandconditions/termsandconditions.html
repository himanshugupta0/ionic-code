    <p>Payment Policy All the payments will be quoted in USD. Customers paying through international credit cards from other
        countries will be charged the equivalent USD amount in their currency at the prevailing exchange rate. The payment
        review panel will give quote for the payment as some services may vary in nature and workforce. A full detailed invoice
        will be generated and will be sent to your mail. The service will only start if and only if payment is done. Pricing
        Policy Some service could vary in their costs due to the third party involvement and extra workforce. So we have
        adopted two layered pricing policy. Flat pricing will be applicable only on yearly plans but as per the fluctuations
        in foreign currency, monthly plan pricing may vary. According to the nature of the job and requirements, the cost
        may also rise. In such cases, some extra cost may be levied based on efforts. The quoted price may vary, it shall
        not be taken as final amount as it may vary due to actual. Based on this initial payment, the effort and cost estimate
        is estimated and quoted to the client. The customer is free to accept the quote and proceed with the order or request
        a full refund if the cost estimate does not fit his / her requirement.</p>

    <p>Refund Policy:</p>

        services may be governed by their individual refund policies. Refunds on such cancellations will be applicable as
        follows: munshiji247 will deduct 25% of the order value as cancellation fee and the balance shall be refunded when

        other than customer request for cancellation, then refund will be given after deduction of 25% of the order value

    <p>Any additional costs already incurred in executing your task shall also be deducted wherever applicable. Once an order
        is completed, no refunds can be made. Time to refund to process a request for cancellation is a maximum of 7 working
        days. However time lines for actual refund to take place and for the credit to reach your account would depend on
        the speed of banking channels and the credit card companies involved in the transaction (as may be applicable). If
        you have any issues with our refund policy or if your cancellation request is getting delayed, please mail us at
        hello@munshiji247.com.
