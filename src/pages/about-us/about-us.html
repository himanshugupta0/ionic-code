      <p>I requested non-Availability of birth certificate (NABC) for my father's Green card processing. Such a document is hard to procure when you have no address proof for the place where someone is born. I was communicated clearly what is required from my side. Munshiji247 team was updating me with the progress every week, and bureaucratic hurdles they were facing in getting the document. Whenever, my help was required, it was communicated promptly without any delay. Munshiji247 prepared all background documents necessary, engaged with lawyers in the background to get a workable solution. Its hard to explain how tedious this process was, but munshiji247 made it look simple. I am really impressed by the service I received by munshiji247.</p>
