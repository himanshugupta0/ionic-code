In many cases name would not have been mentioned at the time of birth. This makes it more complex, needing a thorough search in municipal records with Parents name and applicants date of birth. Where name is not mentioned at the time of birth registration it can be included by submitting the necessary documents. We will require an authorization letter from applicant in favor of munshiji247 to represent the applicant.
